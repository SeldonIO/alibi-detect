    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The adversarial detector follows the method explained in the [Adversarial Detection and Correction by Matching Prediction Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09364) paper. Usually, autoencoders are trained to find a transformation $T$ that reconstructs the input instance $x$ as accurately as possible with loss functions that are suited to capture the similarities between x and $x'$ such as the mean squared reconstruction error. The novelty of the adversarial autoencoder (AE) detector relies on the use of a classification model-dependent loss function based on a distance metric in the output space of the model to train the autoencoder network. Given a classification model $M$ we optimise the weights of the autoencoder such that the [KL-divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) between the model predictions on $x$ and on $x'$ is minimised. Without the presence of a reconstruction loss term $x'$ simply tries to make sure that the prediction probabilities $M(x')$ and $M(x)$ match without caring about the proximity of $x'$ to $x$. As a result, $x'$ is allowed to live in different areas of the input feature space than $x$ with different decision boundary shapes with respect to the model $M$. The carefully crafted adversarial perturbation which is effective around x does not transfer to the new location of $x'$ in the feature space, and the attack is therefore neutralised. Training of the autoencoder is unsupervised since we only need access to the model prediction probabilities and the normal training instances. We do not require any knowledge about the underlying adversarial attack and the classifier weights are frozen during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "The detector can be used as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An adversarial score $S$ is computed. $S$ equals the K-L divergence between the model predictions on $x$ and $x'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $S$ is above a threshold (explicitly defined or inferred from training data), the instance is flagged as adversarial.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For adversarial instances, the model $M$ uses the reconstructed instance $x'$ to make a prediction. If the adversarial score is below the threshold, the model makes a prediction on the original instance $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure is illustrated in the diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![adversarialae](image/adversarialae.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is very flexible and can also be used to detect common data corruptions and perturbations which negatively impact the model performance. The algorithm works well on tabular and image data."
