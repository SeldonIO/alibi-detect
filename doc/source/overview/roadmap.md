# Roadmap

Alibi-detect aims to be the go-to library for outlier, adversarial and concept drift detection in Python. 

This means that the algorithms in the library need to handle:
* **Online** detection with often stateful detectors.
* **Offline** detection, where the detector is trained on a batch of unsupervised or semi-supervised data. This assumption resembles a lot of real-world settings where labels are hard to come by.

The algorithms will cover the following data types:
* **Tabular**, including both numerical and categorical data.
* **Images**
* **Time series**, both univariate and multivariate.
* **Text**

It will also be possible to combine different algorithms in ensemble detectors.

The library currently covers both online and offline outlier detection algorithms for tabular data, images and time series as well as an offline adversarial detector for tabular data and images. The near term focus will be on concept drift detectors, extending outlier detectors for mixed data types and leveraging labels in a semi-supervised setting.
