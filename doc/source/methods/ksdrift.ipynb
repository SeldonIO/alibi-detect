    "\n",
    "The drift detector applies feature-wise two-sample [Kolmogorov-Smirnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test) (K-S) tests. For multivariate data, the obtained p-values for each feature are aggregated either via the [Bonferroni](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BonferroniCorrection.html) or the [False Discovery Rate](http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~ybenja/MyPapers/benjamini_hochberg1995.pdf) (FDR) correction. The Bonferroni correction is more conservative and controls for the probability of at least one false positive. The FDR correction on the other hand allows for an expected fraction of false positives to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "For high-dimensional data, we typically want to reduce the dimensionality before computing the feature-wise univariate K-S tests and aggregating those via the chosen correction method. Following suggestions in [Failing Loudly: An Empirical Study of Methods for Detecting Dataset Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11953), we incorporate Untrained AutoEncoders (UAE), black-box shift detection using the classifier's softmax outputs ([BBSDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03916)) and [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) as out-of-the box preprocessing methods. Preprocessing methods which do not rely on the classifier will usually pick up drift in the input data, while BBSDs focuses on label shift."

    "\n",
    "### Initialize\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `p_val`: p-value used for significance of the K-S test for each feature. If the FDR correction method is used, this corresponds to the acceptable q-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `X_ref`: Data used as reference distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `update_X_ref`: Reference data can optionally be updated to the last N instances seen by the detector or via [reservoir sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling) with size N. For the former, the parameter equals *{'last': N}* while for reservoir sampling *{'reservoir_sampling': N}* is passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `preprocess_fn`: Function to preprocess the data before computing the data drift metrics. Typically a dimensionality reduction technique. The out-of-the box methods UAE, BBSDs and PCA are illustrated in the [example notebook](../examples/cd_ks_cifar10.nblink).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `preprocess_kwargs`: Keyword arguments for `preprocess_fn`. Again see the [notebook](../examples/cd_ks_cifar10.nblink) for concrete examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `correction`: Correction type for multivariate data. Either *'bonferroni'* or *'fdr'* (False Discovery Rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `alternative`: Defines the alternative hypothesis. Options are *'two-sided'* (default), *'less'* or *'greater'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_features`: Number of features used in the K-S test. No need to pass it if no preprocessing takes place. In case of a preprocessing step, this can also be inferred automatically but could be more expensive to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_infer`: If the number of features need to be inferred after the preprocessing step, we can specify the number of instances used to infer the number of features from since this can depend on the specific preprocessing step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `data_type`: can specify data type added to metadata. E.g. *'tabular'* or *'image'*.\n",

    "### Detect Drift\n",
    "\n",
    "We detect data drift by simply calling `predict` on a batch of instances `X`. We can return the feature-wise p-values before the multivariate correction by setting `return_feature_score` to *True*. The drift can also be detected at the feature level by setting `drift_type` to *'feature'*. No multivariate correction will take place since we return the output of *n_features* univariate tests. For drift detection on all the features combined with the correction, use *'batch'*.\n",
