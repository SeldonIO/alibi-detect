    "[Model distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) is a technique that is used to transfer knowledge from a large network to a smaller network. Typically, it consists of training a second model with a simplified architecture on soft targets (the output distributions or the logits) obtained from the original model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we apply model distillation to obtain harmfulness scores, by comparing the output distributions of the original model with the output distributions \n",
    "of the distilled model, in order to detect adversarial data, malicious data drift or data corruption.\n",
    "We use the following definition of harmful and harmless data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Harmful data points are defined as inputs for which the model's predictions on the uncorrupted data are correct while the model's predictions on the corrupted data are wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Harmless data points are defined as inputs for which the model's predictions on the uncorrupted data are correct and the model's predictions on the corrupted data remain correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogously to the [adversarial AE detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09364), which is also part of the library, the model distillation detector picks up drift that reduces the performance of the classification model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The detector can be used as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given an input $x,$ an adversarial score $S(x)$ is computed. $S(x)$ equals the value loss function employed for distillation calculated between the original model's output and the distilled model's output on $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $S(x)$ is above a threshold (explicitly defined or inferred from training data), the instance is flagged as adversarial."

    "Parameters:\n",
