    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The outlier detector described by [Ren et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02845) in [Likelihood Ratios for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02845) uses the likelihood ratio (LLR) between 2 generative models as the outlier score. One model is trained on the original data while the other is trained on a perturbed version of the dataset. This is based on the observation that the log likelihood for an instance under a generative model can be heavily affected by population level background statistics. The second generative model is therefore trained to capture the background statistics still present in the perturbed data while the semantic features have been erased by the perturbations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perturbations are added using an independent and identical Bernoulli distribution with rate $\\mu$ which substitutes a feature with one of the other possible feature values with equal probability. For images, this means for instance changing a pixel with a different pixel value randomly sampled within the $0$ to $255$ pixel range. The package also contains a [PixelCNN++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05517) implementation adapted from the official TensorFlow Probability [version](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/PixelCNN), and available as a standalone model in `alibi_detect.models.pixelcnn`."

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `threshold`: outlier threshold value used for the negative likelihood ratio. Scores above the threshold are flagged as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `model`: a generative model, either as a `tf.keras.Model`, TensorFlow Probability distribution or built-in PixelCNN++ model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `model_background`: optional separate model fit on the perturbed background data. If this is not specified, a copy of `model` will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `log_prob`: if the model does not have a `log_prob` function like e.g. a TensorFlow Probability distribution, a function needs to be passed that evaluates the log likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sequential`: flag whether the data is sequential or not. Used to create targets during training. Defaults to *False*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `data_type`: can specify data type added to metadata. E.g. *'tabular'* or *'image'*.\n",

    "* `X`: training batch as a numpy array of preferably normal data.\n",

    "* `loss_fn`: loss function used for the generative models.\n",

    "* `optimizer`: optimizer used for training. Defaults to [Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) with learning rate 1e-3.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `epochs`: number of training epochs.\n",

    "\n",
    "We detect outliers by simply calling `predict` on a batch of instances `X`. Detection can be customized via the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `outlier_type`: either *'instance'* or *'feature'*. If the outlier type equals *'instance'*, the outlier score at the instance level will be used to classify the instance as an outlier or not. If *'feature'* is selected, outlier detection happens at the feature level (e.g. by pixel in images).\n",
