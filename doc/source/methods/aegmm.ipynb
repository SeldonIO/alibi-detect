    "The Auto-Encoding Gaussian Mixture Model (AEGMM) Outlier Detector follows the [Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJJLHbb0-) paper. The encoder compresses the data while the reconstructed instances generated by the decoder are used to create additional features based on the reconstruction error between the input and the reconstructions. These features are combined with encodings and fed into a Gaussian Mixture Model ([GMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model#Gaussian_mixture_model)). The AEGMM outlier detector is first trained on a batch of unlabeled, but normal (*inlier*) data. Unsupervised or semi-supervised training is desirable since labeled data is often scarce. The sample energy of the GMM can then be used to determine whether an instance is an outlier (high sample energy) or not (low sample energy). The algorithm is suitable for tabular and image data."
