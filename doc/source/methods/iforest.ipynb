    "[Isolation forests](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf) (IF) are tree based models specifically used for outlier detection. The IF isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. The number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path length from the root node to the terminating node. This path length, averaged over a forest of random trees, is a measure of normality and is used to define an anomaly score. Outliers can typically be isolated quicker, leading to shorter paths. The algorithm is suitable for low to medium dimensional tabular data."

    "* `max_samples`: number of samples to draw from the training data to train each base estimator. If *int*, draw `max_samples` samples. If *float*, draw `max_samples` *times number of features* samples. If *'auto'*, `max_samples` = min(256, number of samples).\n",

    "* `bootstrap`: whether to fit individual trees on random subsets of the training data, sampled with replacement.\n",

    "* `n_jobs`: number of jobs to run in parallel for `fit` and `predict`.\n",
