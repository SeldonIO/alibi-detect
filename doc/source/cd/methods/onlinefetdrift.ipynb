    "Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `x_ref`: Data used as reference distribution.\n",
    "* `ert`: The expected run-time (ERT) in the absence of drift.\n",
    "* `window_size`: The size(s) of the sliding test-window(s) used to compute the test-statistic. Smaller windows focus on responding quickly to severe drift, larger windows focus on ability to detect slight drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyword arguments:\n",
    "TODO - describe alternative etc in more detail\n",
    "\n",
    "* `preprocess_fn`: Function to preprocess the data before computing the data drift metrics.\n",
    "* `n_bootstraps`: The number of bootstrap simulations used to configure the thresholds. The larger this is the more accurately the desired ERT will be targeted. Should ideally be at least an order of magnitude larger than the ERT.\n",
    "* `alternative`: The alternative hypothesis. Options are 'less' or 'greater'.\n",
    "* `lam`: Smoothing coefficient used for exponential moving average.\n",
    "* `t_max`: Length of streams to simulate. If `None`, this is set to 2 * max(`window_size`) - 1.\n",
    "* `verbose`: Whether or not to print progress during configuration.\n",
    "* `input_shape`: Shape of input data.\n",
    "* `data_type`: Optionally specify the data type (tabular, image or time-series). Added to metadata.\n",

    "We detect data drift by sequentially calling `predict` on single instances `x_t` (no batch dimension) as they each arrive. We can return the test-statistic and the threshold by setting `return_test_stat` to *True*.\n",

    "* `is_drift`: 1 if the test-window (of the most recent `window_size` observations) has drifted from the reference data and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `time`: The number of observations that have been so far passed to the detector as test instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ert`: The expected run-time the detector was configured to run at in the absence of drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `test_stat`: FET test-statistic between the reference data and the test_window if `return_test_stat` equals *True*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `threshold`: The value the test-statsitic is required to exceed for drift to be detected if `return_test_stat` equals *True*.\n",
