    "# Least-Squares Density Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The [least-squares density difference detector](https://alippi.faculty.polimi.it/articoli/A%20Pdf%20free%20Change%20Detection%20Test%20Based%20on%20Density%20Difference%20Estimation.pdf) is a method for multivariate 2 sample testing. The LSDD between two distributions $p$ and $q$ on $\\mathcal{X}$ is defined as $$LSDD(p,q) = \\int_{\\mathcal{X}} (p(x)-q(x))^2 \\,dx.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two samples we can compute an estimate of the $LSDD$ between the two underlying distributions and use it as a test statistic. We then obtain a $p$-value via a [permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)) on the values of the $LSDD$ estimates. In practice we actually estimate the LSDD scaled by a factor that maintains numerical stability when dimensionality is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "For high-dimensional data, we typically want to reduce the dimensionality before computing the permutation test. Following suggestions in [Failing Loudly: An Empirical Study of Methods for Detecting Dataset Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11953), we incorporate Untrained AutoEncoders (UAE) and black-box shift detection using the classifier's softmax outputs ([BBSDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03916)) as out-of-the box preprocessing methods and note that [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) can also be easily implemented using `scikit-learn`. Preprocessing methods which do not rely on the classifier will usually pick up drift in the input data, while BBSDs focuses on label shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting input data drift (covariate shift) $\\Delta p(x)$ for text data requires a custom preprocessing step. We can pick up changes in the semantics of the input by extracting (contextual) embeddings and detect drift on those. Strictly speaking we are not detecting $\\Delta p(x)$ anymore since the whole training procedure (objective function, training data etc) for the (pre)trained embeddings has an impact on the embeddings we extract. The library contains functionality to leverage pre-trained embeddings from [HuggingFace's transformer package](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) but also allows you to easily use your own embeddings of choice. Both options are illustrated with examples in the [Text drift detection on IMDB movie reviews](../../examples/cd_text_imdb.ipynb) notebook."

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `x_ref`: Data used as reference distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `backend`: Both **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** implementations of the LSD detector as well as various preprocessing steps are available. Specify the backend (*tensorflow* or *pytorch*). Defaults to *tensorflow*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `p_val`: p-value used for significance of the permutation test.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `preprocess_x_ref`: Whether to already apply the (optional) preprocessing step to the reference data at initialization and store the preprocessed data. Dependent on the preprocessing step, this can reduce the computation time for the predict step significantly, especially when the reference dataset is large. Defaults to *True*. It is possible that it needs to be set to *False* if the preprocessing step requires statistics from both the reference and test data, such as the mean or standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `update_x_ref`: Reference data can optionally be updated to the last N instances seen by the detector or via [reservoir sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling) with size N. For the former, the parameter equals *{'last': N}* while for reservoir sampling *{'reservoir_sampling': N}* is passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `preprocess_fn`: Function to preprocess the data before computing the data drift metrics. Typically a dimensionality reduction technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sigma`: Optionally set the bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel used in estimating the LSDD. Can also pass multiple bandwidth values as an array. The kernel evaluation is then averaged over those bandwidths.  If `sigma` is not specified, the 'median heuristic' is adopted whereby `sigma` is set as the median pairwise distance between reference samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_permutations`: Number of permutations used in the permutation test.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_kernel_centers`: The number of reference samples to use as centers in the Gaussian kernel model used to estimate LSDD. Defaults to 1/20th of the reference data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `lambda_rd_max`: The maximum relative difference between two estimates of LSDD that the regularization parameter lambda is allowed to cause. Defaults to 0.2 as in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `input_shape`: Optionally pass the shape of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `data_type`: can specify data type added to the metadata. E.g. *'tabular'* or *'image'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional PyTorch keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `device`: *cuda* or *gpu* to use the GPU and *cpu* for the CPU. If the device is not specified, the detector will try to leverage the GPU if possible and otherwise fall back on CPU.\n",
