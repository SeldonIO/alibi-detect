    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The spot-the-diff drift detector is an extension of the [Classifier](./classifierdrift.ipynb) drift detector where the classifier is specified in a manner that makes detections interpretable at the feature level when they occur. The detector is inspired by the work of [Jitkrittum et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06796) but various major adaptations have been made.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the usual classifier-based approach, a portion of the available data is used to train a classifier that can disciminate reference instances from test instances. If the classifier can learn to discriminate in a generalisable manner then drift must have occured. Here we additionally enforce that the classifier takes the form $$\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_T) = b_0 + b_1 k(x,w_1) + ... + b_Jk(x,w_J),$$ where $\\hat{p}_T$ is the predicted probability that instance $x$ is from the test window (rather than reference), $k(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is a kernel specifying a notion of similarity between instances, $w_i$ are learnable *test locations* and $b_i$ are learnable regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the detector flags drift and $b_i >0$ then we know that it reached its decision by considering how similar each instance is to the instance $w_i$, with those being more similar being more likely to be test instances than reference instances. Alternatively if $b_i < 0$ then instances more similar to $w_i$ were deemed more likely to be reference instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provide less noisy and therefore more interpretable results, we define each test location as $$w_i = \\bar{x}+d_i$$ where $\\bar{x}$ is the mean reference instance. We may then interpret $d_i$ as the additive transformation deemed to make the average reference more ($b_i>0$) or less ($b_i<0$) similar to a test instance. Defining the test locations in this way allows us to instead learn the *difference* $d_i$ and apply regularisation such that non-zero values must be justified by improved classification performance.  This allows us to more clearly identify which features any detected drift should be attributed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the standard classifier-based approach, we should specify the proportion of data to use for training and testing respectively as well as training arguments such as the learning rate and batch size. Note that classifier is trained for each test set that is passed for detection."

    "* `n_diffs`:  The number of test locations to use, each corresponding to an interpretable difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `initial_diffs`: Array used to initialise the diffs that will be learned. Defaults to Gaussian for each feature with equal variance to that of reference data.\n",

    "\n",
    "* `train_size`: Optional fraction (float between 0 and 1) of the dataset used to train the classifier. The drift is detected on *1 - train_size*. Cannot be used in combination with `n_folds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_folds`: Optional number of stratified folds used for training. The model preds are then calculated on all the out-of-fold instances. This allows to leverage all the reference and test data for drift detection at the expense of longer computation. If both `train_size` and `n_folds` are specified, `n_folds` is prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `retrain_from_scratch`: Whether the classifier should be retrained from scratch for each set of test data or whether it should instead continue training from where it left off on the previous set.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `seed`: Optional random seed for fold selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `optimizer`: Optimizer used during training of the kernel. From `torch.optim` for PyTorch and `tf.keras.optimizers` for TensorFlow.\n",

For PyTorch, the dataset should only take the data x and the array of labels y as input, so when e.g. *TorchDataset* is passed to the detector at initialisation, during training *TorchDataset(x, y)* is used. For TensorFlow, the dataset is an instance of `tf.keras.utils.Sequence`, so when e.g. *TFDataset* is passed to the detector at initialisation, during training *TFDataset(x, y, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)* is used. x can be of type np.ndarray or List[Any] while y is of type np.ndarray.\n",

    "\n",
    "* `dataloader`: Dataloader object used during training of the classifier. Defaults to `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. The dataloader is not initialized yet, this is done during init off the detector using the `batch_size`. Custom dataloaders can be passed as well, e.g. for graph data we can use `torch_geometric.data.DataLoader`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Any differentiable *Pytorch* or *TensorFlow* module that takes as input two instances and outputs a scalar (representing similarity) can be used as the kernel for this drift detector. By default a simple [Gaussian RBF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_kernel) kernel is used. Keeping the kernel simple can aid interpretability, but alternatively a \"deep kernel\" of the form $$k(x,y)=(1-\\epsilon)*k_a(\\Phi(x), \\Phi(y)) + \\epsilon*k_b(x,y),$$ where $\\Phi$ is a (differentiable) projection, $k_a$ and $k_b$ are simple kernels (such as a Gaussian RBF) and $\\epsilon>0$ a small constant can be used. The `DeepKernel` class found in either `alibi_detect.utils.tensorflow.kernels` or `alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels` aims to make defining such kernels straightforward. You should not allow too many learnable parameters however as we would like the classifier to discriminate using the test locations rather than kernel parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantiating the detector\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantiating the detector is as simple as passing your reference data and selecting a backend, but you should also consider the number of \"diffs\" you would like your model to use to discriminate reference from test instances and the strength of regularisation you would like to apply to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `n_diffs=1` is the simplest to interpret and seems to work well in practice. Using more diffs may result in stronger detection power but the diffs may be harder to interpret due to intereactions and conditional dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of the regularisation (`l1_reg`) to apply to the diffs should also be specified. Stronger regularisation results in sparser diffs as the classifier is encouraged to discriminate using fewer features. This may make the diff more interpretable but may again come at the cost of detection power.\n",
