    "# Maximum Mean Discrepancy\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v13/gretton12a.html) detector is a kernel-based method for multivariate 2 sample testing. The MMD is a distance-based measure between 2 distributions *p* and *q* based on the mean embeddings $\\mu_{p}$ and $\\mu_{q}$ in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $F$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MMD(F, p, q) = || \\mu_{p} - \\mu_{q} ||^2_{F}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute unbiased estimates of $MMD^2$ from the samples of the 2 distributions after applying the kernel trick. We use by default a [radial basis function kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_kernel), but users are free to pass their own kernel of preference to the detector. We obtain a $p$-value via a [permutation test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)) on the values of $MMD^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For high-dimensional data, we typically want to reduce the dimensionality before computing the permutation test. Following suggestions in [Failing Loudly: An Empirical Study of Methods for Detecting Dataset Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11953), we incorporate Untrained AutoEncoders (UAE) and black-box shift detection using the classifier's softmax outputs ([BBSDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03916)) as out-of-the box preprocessing methods and note that [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) can also be easily implemented using `scikit-learn`. Preprocessing methods which do not rely on the classifier will usually pick up drift in the input data, while BBSDs focuses on label shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting input data drift (covariate shift) $\\Delta p(x)$ for text data requires a custom preprocessing step. We can pick up changes in the semantics of the input by extracting (contextual) embeddings and detect drift on those. Strictly speaking we are not detecting $\\Delta p(x)$ anymore since the whole training procedure (objective function, training data etc) for the (pre)trained embeddings has an impact on the embeddings we extract. The library contains functionality to leverage pre-trained embeddings from [HuggingFace's transformer package](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) but also allows you to easily use your own embeddings of choice. Both options are illustrated with examples in the [Text drift detection on IMDB movie reviews](../../examples/cd_text_imdb.ipynb) notebook."

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `x_ref`: Data used as reference distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `backend`: Both **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** implementations of the MMD detector as well as various preprocessing steps are available. Specify the backend (*tensorflow* or *pytorch*). Defaults to *tensorflow*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `p_val`: p-value used for significance of the permutation test.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `preprocess_x_ref`: Whether to already apply the (optional) preprocessing step to the reference data at initialization and store the preprocessed data. Dependent on the preprocessing step, this can reduce the computation time for the predict step significantly, especially when the reference dataset is large. Defaults to *True*. It is possible that it needs to be set to *False* if the preprocessing step requires statistics from both the reference and test data, such as the mean or standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `update_x_ref`: Reference data can optionally be updated to the last N instances seen by the detector or via [reservoir sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling) with size N. For the former, the parameter equals *{'last': N}* while for reservoir sampling *{'reservoir_sampling': N}* is passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `preprocess_fn`: Function to preprocess the data before computing the data drift metrics. Typically a dimensionality reduction technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `kernel`: Kernel used when computing the MMD. Defaults to a Gaussian RBF kernel (`from alibi_detect.utils.pytorch import GaussianRBF` or `from alibi_detect.utils.tensorflow import GaussianRBF` dependent on the backend used).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sigma`: Optional bandwidth for the kernel as a `np.ndarray`. We can also average over a number of different bandwidths, e.g. `np.array([.5, 1., 1.5])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `configure_kernel_from_x_ref`: If `sigma` is not specified, the detector can infer it via a heuristic and set `sigma` to the median pairwise distance between 2 samples. If `configure_kernel_from_x_ref` is *True*, we can already set `sigma` at initialization of the detector by inferring it from `x_ref`, speeding up the prediction step. If set to *False*, `sigma` is computed separately for each test batch at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n_permutations`: Number of permutations used in the permutation test.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `input_shape`: Optionally pass the shape of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `data_type`: can specify data type added to the metadata. E.g. *'tabular'* or *'image'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional PyTorch keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `device`: *cuda* or *gpu* to use the GPU and *cpu* for the CPU. If the device is not specified, the detector will try to leverage the GPU if possible and otherwise fall back on CPU.\n",
