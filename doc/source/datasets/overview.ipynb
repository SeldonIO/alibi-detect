    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The package also contains functionality in `alibi_detect.datasets` to easily fetch a number of datasets for different modalities. For each dataset either the data and labels or a *Bunch* object with the data, labels and optional metadata are returned. Example:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "from alibi_detect.datasets import fetch_ecg\n",

    "  - Bacteria genomics dataset for out-of-distribution detection, released as part of [Likelihood Ratios for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02845). From the original *TL;DR*: *The dataset contains genomic sequences of 250 base pairs from 10 in-distribution bacteria classes for training, 60 OOD bacteria classes for validation, and another 60 different OOD bacteria classes for test*. There are respectively 1, 7 and again 7 million sequences in the training, validation and test sets. For detailed info on the dataset check the [README](https://storage.cloud.google.com/seldon-datasets/genome/readme.docx?organizationId=156002945562).\n",

    "  - CIFAR-10-C ([Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261)) contains the test set of CIFAR-10, but corrupted and perturbed by various types of noise, blur, brightness etc. at different levels of severity, leading to a gradual decline in a classification model's performance trained on CIFAR-10. `fetch_cifar10c` allows you to pick any severity level or corruption type. The list with available corruption types can be retrieved with `alibi_detect.datasets.corruption_types_cifar10c()`. The dataset can be used in research on robustness and drift. The original data can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/2535967#.XnAM2nX7RNw). Example:\n",
