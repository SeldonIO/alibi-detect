    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Sequence-to-Sequence](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf) (Seq2Seq) outlier detector consists of 2 main building blocks: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder consists of a [Bidirectional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks) [LSTM](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) which processes the input sequence and initializes the decoder. The LSTM decoder then makes sequential predictions for the output sequence. In our case, the decoder aims to reconstruct the input sequence. If the input data cannot be reconstructed well, the reconstruction error is high and the data can be flagged as an outlier. The reconstruction error is measured as the mean squared error (MSE) between the input and the reconstructed instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since even for normal data the reconstruction error can be state-dependent, we add an outlier threshold estimator network to the Seq2Seq model. This network takes in the hidden state of the decoder at each timestep and predicts the estimated reconstruction error for normal data. As a result, the outlier threshold is not static and becomes a function of the model state. This is similar to [Park et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00614.pdf), but while they train the threshold estimator separately from the Seq2Seq model with a Support-Vector Regressor, we train a neural net regression network end-to-end with the Seq2Seq model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detector is first trained on a batch of unlabeled, but normal (*inlier*) data. Unsupervised training is desireable since labeled data is often scarce. The Seq2Seq outlier detector is suitable for both **univariate and multivariate time series**."

    "It is often hard to find a good threshold value. If we have a batch of normal and outlier data and we know approximately the percentage of normal data in the batch, we can infer a suitable threshold. We can either set the threshold over both features combined or determine a feature-wise threshold. Here we opt for the feature-wise threshold. This is for instance useful when different features have different variance or sensitivity to outliers. The snippet assumes there are about 5% outliers in the first feature and 10% in the second:\n",
