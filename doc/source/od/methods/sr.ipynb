    "The Spectral Residual outlier detector is based on the paper [Time-Series Anomaly Detection Service at Microsoft](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03821) and is suitable for **unsupervised online anomaly detection in univariate time series** data. The algorithm first computes the [Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) of the original data. Then it computes the *spectral residual* of the log amplitude of the transformed signal before applying the Inverse Fourier Transform to map the sequence back from the frequency to the time domain. This sequence is called the *saliency map*. The anomaly score is then computed as the relative difference between the saliency map values and their moving averages. If the score is above a threshold, the value at a specific timestep is flagged as an outlier. For more details, please check out the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03821)."
